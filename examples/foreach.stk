; Right-to-left, for parsing means list may look 'reversed'
foreach! i {i3 i2 i1} {
	print! i$
}

; Of course, you can rewrite however is comfortable:
{
	print! i$
}
{
	i1
	i2
	i3
}
foreach! i

; `reverse` is probably the nicest to use.
; Remember: foreach reads a stack, not a group of arguments.
; You can process things inline before handing them over.
foreach! i reverse! {i1 i2 i3} {
	print! i$
}
