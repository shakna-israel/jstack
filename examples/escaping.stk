Strings can be escaped with the \ character.
If there is no special escape, then it will become literally the next character.

e.g. \" becomes "

However, there are a handful of special escapes:

* \n becomes the newline character.
* \r becomes the carriage return character.

print! "Hello\nWorld!"

print! "Hello \\ World!"
