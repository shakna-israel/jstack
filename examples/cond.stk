; Multi-branching conditional:

cond! {
	{false} {print! "Nope."}
	{false} {print! "Not this one."}
	{true} {print! Here}
}

; However, be aware of the parser - it is right-to-left.
cond! {
	{print! "Nope."}
	{false}

	{print! "Not this one."}
	{false}

	{true} {print! Here}
}

; You can generate conditionals and so on at runtime, of course.
